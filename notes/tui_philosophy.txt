Terminals vary in:
how they encode Alt/meta
ESC timeout behavior
how they report Ctrl+<something>
support for Ctrl+Shift
support for Ctrl+Arrow, Shift+Arrow
Unicode input
locale
OS keyboard layouts
terminal emulator quirks (VTE, Konsole, xterm, Kitty, Alacritty, etc.)

You cannot rely universally on:
Alt+anything
Shift as a standalone modifier
Shift combined with arrow keys
Ctrl combined with non-ASCII
Multi-modifier combos (Ctrl+Alt+Shift)
Function keys beyond F12 working consistently

The ONLY safe, guaranteed combos are:
Guaranteed (universally reliable):
Ctrl+A → Ctrl+Z
Ctrl+@ → some Ctrl+_] depending on layout
Enter, Esc, Tab, Backspace
Arrow keys
Function keys (F1–F12 mostly safe, but not beyond)
Printable ASCII characters
UTF-8 text input (except ctrl-modified)
Everything else is terminal-dependent, sometimes even OS-dependent.
